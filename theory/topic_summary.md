### Summary of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) Course

#### 1. Introduction to Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
- **Trends in Computing:**
  - Ubiquity, interconnection, intelligence, delegation, human-orientation.
- **Agent Definition:**
  - Agents are autonomous systems acting in dynamic environments.
- **MAS Characteristics:**
  - A collection of agents interacting to achieve goals through cooperation, coordination, and negotiation.
- **Objections to MAS:**
  - Differences between MAS, distributed systems, AI, economics, and social sciences.
- **Agent vs. Related Technologies:**
  - Compared with objects (OOP) and expert systems.

#### 2. Agent Architectures
- **Types of Architectures:**
  - **Reactive:** Immediate response, simple, based on stimulus-action rules.
  - **Deliberative:** Goal-oriented, uses planning and reasoning.
  - **Hybrid:** Combines reactive and deliberative approaches.
- **Environment Types:**
  - Accessible/inaccessible, deterministic/non-deterministic, episodic/non-episodic, static/dynamic, discrete/continuous.
- **Key Models:**
  - Subsumption architecture, BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention).

#### 3. Agent Properties and Types
- **Core Properties:**
  - Reactivity, proactiveness, autonomy, social ability, rationality, reasoning, learning.
- **Types of Agents:**
  - Collaborative, interface, information, facilitator, and translators.
- **Agentification Mechanisms:**
  - Translators, wrappers, or re-coding applications into agents.

#### 4. Agent Communication
- **Communication Mechanisms:**
  - Blackboard systems, message passing, FIPA standards.
- **Protocols:**
  - Speech acts (query, inform, request, etc.), contract nets for task sharing.
- **Challenges:**
  - Coordination, conflict management, result synthesis.

#### 5. Cooperation in MAS – Partial Global Planning (PGP)
- **Coordination Goals:**
  - Ensures agents act coherently while solving distributed problems.
- **PGP Phases:**
  1. Local plan creation.
  2. Plan exchange.
  3. Partial global plan generation.
  4. Optimization.
- **Generalized PGP (GPGP):**
  - Modular, domain-independent coordination.

---

#### 6. Cooperation in MAS – Coalition Formation
- **Definition:**
  - Temporary groups of agents working together to complete tasks.
- **Coalition Formation:**
  - Internal (self-organized) vs. external (imposed).
  - Includes coalition value calculation, structure generation, and pay-off distribution.
- **Task Allocation:**
  - Aligns agent capabilities with task requirements.

---

#### 7. Cooperation in MAS – Auctions
- **Auction Types:**
  - English (ascending), Dutch (descending), sealed-bid (first-price, Vickrey), combinatorial.
- **Advanced Mechanisms:**
  - Multi-unit, multi-attribute, combinatorial auctions.
- **Challenges:**
  - Winner’s curse, sniping, information revelation.

---

#### 8. Cooperation in MAS – Voting Protocols
- **Voting Mechanisms:**
  - Plurality, anti-plurality, best-worst, approval, Borda, Condorcet.
- **Challenges:**
  - Arrow’s impossibility theorem, strategic voting, ordering problems.
- **Advanced Methods:**
  - Linguistic votes, uncertain opinions.
