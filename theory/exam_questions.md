- b) Deliberation is about choosing actions, while means-ends reasoning is about choosing goals.
- c) Deliberation is about choosing beliefs, while means-ends reasoning is about choosing desires.

**8. What is the main idea of speech act theory?**
- a) Communication is not only about conveying information, but also about performing actions.
- b) Communication is not only about performing actions, but also about conveying information.
- c) Communication is not only about the literal meaning of words, but also about the context and intention of the speaker.
- d) Communication is not only about the context and intention of the speaker, but also about the literal meaning of words.

**9. What is agent communication language (ACL)?**
- a) A formal language that defines the syntax and semantics of messages exchanged by agents.
- b) A natural language that allows agents to communicate with humans and other agents.
- c) A programming language that implements the logic and behavior of agents.
- d) A graphical language that represents the structure and interaction of agents.

**10. Which are the main components of an ACL message?**
- a) Sender, receiver, content, and type.
- b) Performative, proposition, sender, and receiver.
- c) Content, context, intention, and effect.
- d) All of the above are equivalent ways of describing the same components.

**11. What are the main types of communication protocols in multi-agent systems?**
- a) Request, query, inform, and subscribe.
- b) Contract net, auction, voting, and negotiation.
- c) TCP, UDP, HTTP, and SMTP.
- d) All of the above.

**12. An example of a speech act is:**

- c) (inform :sender Alice :receiver Bob :content (gave Alice chocolate Bob))
- d) All of the above.

**14. What is coordination through joint intentions?**
- a) A coordination approach that involves forming and maintaining mental attitudes that represent the mutual beliefs and commitments of a group of agents.
- b) A coordination approach that involves expressing and understanding the intentions and desires of other agents through natural language or gestures.
- c) A coordination approach that involves aligning and harmonizing the intentions and actions of agents through reinforcement learning or game theory.
- d) None of the above.

**15. What is the plurality voting procedure?**
- a) A voting procedure in which each agent votes for one alternative, and the alternative with the most votes wins.
- b) A voting procedure in which each agent ranks the alternatives from the most preferred to the least preferred, and the alternative with the highest average rank wins.
- c) A voting procedure in which each agent assigns a score to each alternative, and the alternative with the highest total score wins.
- d) A voting procedure in which each agent votes for a subset of alternatives, and the alternative with the most votes wins.
