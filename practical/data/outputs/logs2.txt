# Agent: Emergency Call Agent
## Task: Process the emergency call transcript and extract structured information. The transcript is, A gas fire has broken out at coordinates (x: 41.71892, y: 2.84127). The fire is classified as high severity at an abandoned warehouse facility. The hazard present is a storage area containing multiple industrial gas cylinders, which poses a significant risk of explosion. The fire is indoors, but the building has been confirmed empty and unused for several months. No individuals are trapped or at risk, and a security check of the premises has confirmed no squatters or unauthorized persons are present. The fire poses a risk of spreading to neighboring structures if not contained quickly.
