The firefighting response was carried out in a well-coordinated manner, with each team playing a crucial role in the overall effort. Firefighter Team Alpha successfully operated the 2,500 GPM water pump unit, ensuring an adequate water supply for multiple buildings. They monitored water pressure and flow rates to optimize pumping efficiency, which helped to reduce response times and minimize damage.

Firefighter Team Bravo effectively deployed the Thermal Ventilation Fan Unit, enhancing ventilation in the fire scene. They also operated the Positive Pressure Ventilation Fans to manage air quality and prevent backdrafts, thereby reducing the risk of explosive gas buildup.

Meanwhile, Firefighter Team Charlie conducted confined space rescue operations using the Confined Space Entry Systems, utilizing Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses (SCBAs) for entry personnel. Their efforts ensured that trapped individuals were safely evacuated from the affected areas.

Firefighter Team Delta successfully deployed the Portable Fire Extinguishers with Foam Agent to tackle Class A, B, and C fires, providing effective fire suppression capabilities. They also operated the Dry Chemical Agent extinguisher in situations where foam was not effective.

In addition to their firefighting duties, members of Firefighter Team Echo conducted initial fire safety assessments and provided guidance on evacuation procedures for trapped individuals. Their efforts helped to minimize risk and promote a swift response.

Firefighter Team Foxtrot effectively coordinated the firefighting efforts, providing command and communication support to ensure seamless teamwork among crew members. They operated hand-held radios and base stations to maintain clear communication, which was instrumental in facilitating effective decision-making under pressure.

The Logistics and Equipment Management team, comprising Firefighter Team Golf, successfully managed the deployment of equipment, including fire extinguishers, pumps, and ventilation units. Their efforts ensured that all necessary supplies were available on scene, minimizing downtime and maximizing response efficiency.

Firefighter Team Hotel maintained personal protective equipment (PPE), including HFR suits and SCBAs, ensuring that crew members remained safe throughout the operation. Routine checks were performed to ensure proper functioning and safety of gear, which helped to minimize risks and ensure effective firefighting capabilities.

Finally, Firefighter Team India inspected fire department vehicles for maintenance needs, ensuring all necessary supplies were available. They operated reflective triangles or road flares to maintain visibility during the response, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and promoting a safe working environment.

Throughout the operation, medical support was provided by Firefighter Team Juliet, who offered basic life support services, including CPR and first aid. Their efforts helped to stabilize injured personnel and ensure their safety until medical assistance arrived on scene.

All firefighters wore thermal imaging cameras (TIC) goggles to enhance situational awareness and safety during the firefighting operations. This allowed them to better navigate the fire scene, identify potential hazards, and respond more effectively to changing conditions.
