 Recent weeks have seen a series of electrical fires that have left residents concerned about their homes and businesses. The latest incident at 123 Main St was caused by faulty wiring and overloaded circuits, but fortunately, no one was injured.

 However, this incident is not an isolated event. There have been similar incidents in the past few months, all of which were caused by electrical fires due to faulty panels or wiring. These incidents occurred at 456 Elm St; 789 Oak St; and 321 Pine St.
