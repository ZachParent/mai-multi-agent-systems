To update the status of hospitals H1 and H2 using the Hospital Status Updater tool, I will provide the corrected input in the format specified:

```json
[
    {
        "hospital_id": "H1",
        "update_type": "reserve_beds",
        "num_beds_reserved": 2,
        "ambulances_dispatched": 0,
        "paramedics_deployed": 0
    },
    {
        "hospital_id": "H2",
        "update_type": "reserve_beds",
        "num_beds_reserved": 3,
        "ambulances_dispatched": 0,
        "paramedics_deployed": 0
    }
]
```

This corrected input will update the status of hospitals H1 and H2 by reserving 2 beds for H1 and 3 beds for H2, respectively.
