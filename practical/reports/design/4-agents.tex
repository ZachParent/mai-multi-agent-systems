\section{Agent Crews}\label{sec:agents}
In this section we will describe the five agents crews of our model:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Emergency Services.
    \item Firefighters.
    \item Medical Services.
    \item Forensics Team.
    \item Public Communications.
\end{enumerate}
We will discuss the main tasks, tools, types, and properties of each agent that comprises the crews. Figure \ref{fig:diagram} illustrates the interactions between crews of agents as well as among agents within the different crews. Communication between crews is carried out through a communication channel, which only one agent per crew has access to.
