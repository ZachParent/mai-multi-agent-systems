\section{Agent Crews}\label{sec:agents}
In this section we will describe the five agents crews of our model:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Emergency Services.
    \item Firefighters.
    \item Medical Services.
    \item Forensics Team.
    \item Public Communications.
\end{enumerate}
We will discuss the main tasks, tools, types and properties of each of the agents that comprise the crews.
\newline\textcolor{red}{Discuss Tools for those agents who do not have any. Maybe OK to have agents without specific tools?}
