# Introduction

Good afternoon, everyone. We are group 5 and we are presenting our solution for the first task of Introduction to Multiagent system.

In this study, we developed a multi-agent system to coordinate fire-related emergency responses in Lloret de Mar, Girona. Using CrewAI, we organized five specialized teams: emergency services, firefighters, medical services, forensics, and public communications. Each team has distinct roles to ensure efficient collaboration and response. This presentation will focus on the individuals within these teams, leaving their interactions for a future discussion.

# Public communication

The Public Communications team plays a critical role in managing how information is shared with the public during fire-related emergencies. This team is made up of five specialized agents, each with distinct responsibilities. The importance of public communication was especially evident during Spain's recent DANA storm, where timely, accurate updates were essential for public safety and reassurance.

First, we have the Communications Operator, a facilitator agent. Their role is to bridge communication between our team and other emergency crews, such as firefighters and medical services, ensuring smooth information flow during critical moments.

Next, the Archive Keeper serves as the information agent. They store and retrieve data about incidents, providing an organized repository that helps the team stay informed and accurate.

Then, thereâ€™s the Article Writer, responsible for drafting and refining public announcements. They collaborate closely with the Archive Keeper to ensure updates are consistent and clear.

Our Mayor acts as the official spokesperson, reviewing and approving communications to align with city standards. This step is crucial for maintaining trust and coherence in public messaging.

Finally, the Social Media Commentator engages with the public online, sharing morale-boosting commentary on our team's efforts. Their approachable tone helps build community support and provides a balanced perspective during emergencies.

The last three agents are collaborative agents.
