\paragraph{Task Dependencies}
The sequential nature of the process requires to establish task dependencies to define the crew's workflow:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Search Related Cases} and \textit{Draft Initial Article} can be executed in parallel but both depend on \textit{Receive Report}.
	\item \textit{Integrate Additional Information} requires the completion of both \textit{Search Related Cases} and \textit{Draft Initial Article}.
	\item \textit{Review and Authorize Publication} depends on \textit{Integrate Additional Information}.
	\item \textit{Provide Social Media Feedback} requires article approval from the \textit{Mayor}.
\end{itemize}

The task dependencies and agents who perform each task can be observed in Figure~\ref{fig:medical_services_flow}.
