\subsection{Emergency Services Crew}
\begin{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Receive and Assess Call.} 
    The \textit{Emergency Call Agent} receives incoming calls and collects relevant details
    about the incident. The information that this agent receives answers the following six questions and is saved
    in a report:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What type of fire is it? E.g. ordinary, electrical, gas, etc.
        \item Where is it? The location is received as coordinates \((x, y)\).
        \item Is anyone injured? How badly? The answer will be a list of strings, detailing the risk level of each person. If the list 
        if empty then there will be no injured people and it will be unnecessary to report it to the \textit{Medical Service Crew.}
        \item How severe is the fire? It will be considered as low, medium or high.
        % extra inputs
        \item Are there hazards? Examples of hazards could include gas cylinders, chemicals, explosions, etc.
        \item Is it an indoor or outdoor fire? The answer will be either \textit{outdoor} or \textit{indoor}.
        \item Is anyone inside or trapped? The answer will be an integer number $M$ representing the number of trapped people. 
        If $M > 0$, rescues are needed, and the \textit{Notification Agent} will detail that to the Fire Fighters Crew.
    \end{itemize}
    

    \item \textbf{Notify Other Crews.} 
    The \textit{Notification Agent} receives the details about the fire then communicates the information to the 
    appropriate crews (Medical Services Crew and Fire Fighters Crew):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Information provided to the Fire Fighters:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Location \((x, y)\)
            \item Type of fire
            \item How severe is the fire 
            \item Number of trapped people $M$
            \item Hazards
            \item If the fire is indoors or outdoors
        \end{itemize}
        \item Information provided to the Medical Services Crew:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Location \((x, y)\)
            \item Information about the injured people if any
            \item How severe is the fire 
            \item Hazards
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Task Dependencies:}

The sequential workflow for the Emergency Services Crew depends on task dependencies to ensure efficiency and coordination:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{Notify Other Crews Task} depends on the completion of the \textit{Receive and Assess Call Task}.
\end{itemize}

The task dependencies and agents who perform each task can be observed in Figure~\ref{fig:emergency_services_flow}.
