\subsection{Firefighter Agent Crew}

Structured outputs ensure effective communication and accountability among team members in the Firefighter Agent Crew. Below are the Pydantic models designed to encapsulate outputs for each task in the firefighting process:

\subsubsection{Receive Fire Report Task Output}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pydantic model for Receive Fire Report Task Output}]
from pydantic import BaseModel

class FireReportOutput(BaseModel):
    location: Tuple[float, float] # Coordinates (x, y)
    fire_type: str # Type of fire fire_severity: str
    fire_severity: str # Severity of fire: low, medium, or high
    trapped_people: int # Number of trapped individuals
    hazards: List[str] # Hazards present
    hazards_present_indoor: bool # True if fire is indoor, False otherwise
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Give Material Instructions Task Output}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pydantic model for Material Instructions Task Output}]
from pydantic import BaseModel

class MaterialInstructionsOutput(BaseModel):
    material_instructions: str
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Give Firefighting Instructions Task Output}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pydantic model for Firefighting Instructions Task Output}]
from pydantic import BaseModel

class FirefightingInstructionsOutput(BaseModel):
    firefighting_instructions: str
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Allocate Firefighting Resources Task Output}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pydantic model for Allocate Firefighting Resources Task Output}]
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List

class FireFightingMaterial(BaseModel):
    material_name: str
    material_quantity: int

class AllocateFirefightingResourcesOutput(BaseModel):
    resources: List[FireFightingMaterial]
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Deploy Fire Combatants Task Output}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pydantic model for Deploy Fire Combatants Task Output}]
from pydantic import BaseModel

class FirefightingActivity(BaseModel):
    firefighting_activity: str
    priority_level: str

class DeployFireCombatantsOutput(BaseModel):
    firecombatants_deployed: int
    estimated_arrival_time: str
    firefighting_activities: List[FirefightingActivity]
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Report Firefighting Response Task Output}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pydantic model for Report Firefighting Response Task Output}]
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ReportFirefightingResponseOutput(BaseModel):
    summary: str
    timestamp: str
    success: bool
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Summary of Outputs}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Receive Fire Report Task Output:} Captures the essential details from the initial fire report, including fire type, severity, hazards, and any trapped individuals.
\item \textbf{Give Material Instructions Task Output:} Specifies the instructions provided regarding the materials needed for the firefighting operation.
\item \textbf{Give Firefighting Instructions Task Output:} Details the specific firefighting strategies and guidance issued to the crew.
\item \textbf{Allocate Firefighting Resources Task Output:} Documents the allocation of firefighting materials, including quantities and resource types.
\item \textbf{Deploy Fire Combatants Task Output:} Tracks the deployment of personnel, estimated arrival times, and prioritized firefighting activities.
\item \textbf{Report Firefighting Response Task Output:} Summarizes the response outcomes, including success metrics and timestamps.
\end{itemize}
