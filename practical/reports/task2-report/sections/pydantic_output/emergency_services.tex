\subsection{Emergency Services Crew}

Structured outputs ensure accurate information handling and effective communication within the Emergency Services Crew. Below 
are the Pydantic models designed for each task's output.

\subsubsection{Receive and Assess Call Task Output}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pydantic model for Receive and Assess Call Task Output}] 
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    from typing import List, Tuple

    class CallAssessmentOutput(BaseModel): 

    fire_type: str # Type of fire (e.g., ordinary, electrical, gas, etc.) 
    location: Tuple[float, float] # Coordinates (x, y) 
    injured_details: List[str] # List of risk levels of injured people 
    fire_severity: str # Severity of fire: low, medium, or high 
    hazards: List[str] # Hazards present, e.g., gas cylinders, chemicals 
    indoor: bool # True if fire is indoor, False otherwise 
    trapped_people: int # Number of people trapped (0 if none) \end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Notify Other Crews Task Output}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pydantic model for Notify Other Crews Task Output}] 
    from pydantic import BaseModel 
    from typing import List, Tuple

class FireReport(BaseModel): 
    report_id: str
    location: Tuple[float, float] # Coordinates (x, y) 
    fire_type: str # Type of fire fire_severity
    fire_severity: str # Severity of fire: low, medium, or high
    trapped_people: int # Number of trapped individuals 
    hazards: List[str] # Hazards present
    hazards_present_indoor: bool # True if fire is indoor, False otherwise

class MedicalReport(BaseModel): 
    report_id: str
    location: Tuple[float, float] # Coordinates (x, y) 
    injured_details: List[str] # Risk levels of injured people 
    fire_severity: str # Severity of fire: low, medium, or high 
    hazards: List[str] # Hazards present

class CrewNotificationOutput(BaseModel): 
    firefighters_output: List[FireReport]
    medical_service_output: List[MedicalReport]
    timestamp: str # Timestamp of the notification \end{lstlisting}

    \paragraph{Summary of Outputs}
    The Pydantic outputs for the \textit{Emergency Services Crew} ensure structured data handling and effective communication between agents. Below is a summary of the outputs for each task:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Receive and Assess Call Task Output:} Captures critical incident details including fire type, location, injured details, severity, hazards, indoor/outdoor status, and trapped individuals.
        \item \textbf{Notify Other Crews Task Output:} Communicates the assessed incident details to the Firefighter and Medical Services crews. Includes location, fire type, severity, hazards, and relevant medical data such as injuries.
    \end{itemize}
    
    These structured models enhance precision and ensure clear communication throughout the emergency response processes.
