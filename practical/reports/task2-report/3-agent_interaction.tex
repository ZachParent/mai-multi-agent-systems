\section{Agent Interaction}
\subsection{Interaction Flow}
Interaction between crews is designed using a flow-based approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Search and Rescue Crew provides victim data to the Medical Response Crew.
    \item A **Router** determines the priority of medical cases based on data received.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Router Implementation}
The router ensures tasks are efficiently allocated:
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Router Implementation for Task Allocation}]
def router(victim_data):
    if victim_data["priority"] == 1:
        return "Critical Response Team"
    else:
        return "General Response Team"
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Communication Mechanism}
Agents communicate using a message-passing protocol to ensure scalability. An example interaction is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:interaction}.
