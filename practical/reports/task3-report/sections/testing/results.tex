    The article appears to be well-researched and accurately reflects the incident details. However, I would like to see more specificity in the safety protocols section, perhaps highlighting concrete actions residents can take to ensure their own safety. Additionally, it might be beneficial to include a statement about support services available for those affected by the fire.

    ### Social Media Feedback
    BREAKING: Electrical fire in [Neighborhood]! Our firefighting heroes are on the scene, but let's get one thing straight... Why are there THREE identical incidents reported from the same location? Were they separate fires or just a case of copy-paste chaos? Can we get some more transparency on this? Also, great job on having 10 firefighters and 5 paramedics ready to roll in seconds. Your dedication is fire (pun intended)! Just remember, safety protocols are like pizza - even when they're bad, they can still bring people together! #FireSafety #TransparencyMatters
