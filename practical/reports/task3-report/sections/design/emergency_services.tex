\subsubsection{Design}

\paragraph{Purpose}
The Emergency Services crew is responsible for the initial assessment of the emergency situation and the dispatch of the appropriate response teams.

\paragraph{Changes}
In the initial design, the emergency services crew was responsible for directly notifying the other crews
and generating separate assessments for the firefighters crew and the medical services crew, but we
chose to instead generate a single call assessment, which includes the evaluation of whether firefighters
and medical services are required. This assessment is then programmetically used by the flow to call the subsequent crews.
