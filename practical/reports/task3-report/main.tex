\section{Introduction}
This report presents the final implementation and results of our multi-agent system (MAS) for emergency response coordination. Building upon our previous designs from Tasks 1 and 2, we have developed a complete, functional system that demonstrates the effectiveness of agent-based approaches in managing complex emergency scenarios.

The system is implemented using CrewAI, a framework that enables the creation and coordination of specialized agent crews. Each crew is designed with specific responsibilities and operates through well-defined processes, ensuring efficient handling of emergency situations. The implementation includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Emergency Services Crew:} Handles initial emergency assessment and coordination
    \item \textbf{Firefighter Agent Crew:} Manages firefighting resources and operations
    \item \textbf{Medical Services Crew:} Coordinates medical response and hospital resources
    \item \textbf{Public Communication Crew:} Manages public information and communication
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Report Structure:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Section \ref{sec:crew_design} details the design and implementation of each crew, including their process definitions and data models
    \item Section \ref{sec:crew_interaction} explains the interaction mechanisms between crews and the overall system flow
    \item Section \ref{sec:results} presents the results of system testing and validation
    \item Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes with insights and potential future improvements
\end{itemize}

The implementation builds upon our previous design while introducing several refinements based on practical considerations and testing results. These modifications are documented and justified throughout the report. The complete source code, along with setup instructions and required input files, is provided in the accompanying project repository.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
% This report presents a comprehensive multi-agent system for emergency response coordination, implementing sophisticated cooperation mechanisms across specialized crews. The key achievements and insights include:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Process Definition:} Each crew operates with clearly defined sequential workflows:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Emergency Services established structured protocols for initial assessment and crew dispatch
%         \item Firefighters implemented systematic resource allocation and deployment procedures
%         \item Medical Services developed efficient hospital ranking and resource coordination
%         \item Public Communications created an iterative approval workflow with historical case integration
%     \end{itemize}
    
%     \item \textbf{Data Standardization:} Implementation of Pydantic models ensures:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Type-safe data transfer between crews
%         \item Consistent reporting formats
%         \item Structured storage of emergency response states
%     \end{itemize}
    
%     \item \textbf{Coordination Mechanisms:} The system achieves efficient crew interaction through:
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Centralized state management
%         \item Parallel processing capabilities
%         \item Sophisticated routing mechanisms
%         \item Retry systems for critical operations
%     \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of structured agent cooperation in emergency response scenarios. Future work could explore the integration of additional specialized crews (such as Forensics) and further optimization of the coordination mechanisms for larger-scale emergencies.
