\section{Conclusion}
This report offers an overview of the environment and agents in the multi-agent system designed for fire-related emergencies. The insights gathered will guide the next phase of our project, which focuses on establishing effective cooperation and coordination mechanisms to improve emergency response capabilities.

This phase will involve defining the processes each crew will follow, whether sequential or hierarchical, while considering task execution and relevant properties like human input. We will also implement Pydantic outputs for tasks that can benefit from structured data formats. Lastly, we will outline the interaction protocols between agent crews using flow diagrams and routing mechanisms to facilitate seamless information exchange.

By addressing these components, we aim to develop a framework that ensures all agents collaborate effectively to handle outbreaks of fire in Lloret de Mar.
