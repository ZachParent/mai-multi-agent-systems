## meeting notes
- We are getting a lot of hallucinating from the models.
- Not everyone has introduced Pydantic models to their agents and tasks.
- We also have not added any tools.
- Zach says he will start ahead to get a report and presentation structure.
- We should not start writing any specifics until we have sorted out our issues.

- Antonio is working on a way to add Pydantic schema's to the tasks configs.
- If we append the schema of the Pydantics to the tasks, the output will be more similar to what we are expecting.

- Zach will work on the report set-up today.
- We will work asynchronously but constantly report in the group chat to be on the same page.

- Operators recieving information are hallucinating and not filling any specific function, so we might consider removing the first "receive report" tasks.
- Everyone agrees to keep it in Emergency Services to extract key information, and remove it in the rest of the crews.

- Meet again in 1 or 2 days, when everyone has added schemas, removed the unnecessary tasks and added tools.

Total meeting time: 60 min
