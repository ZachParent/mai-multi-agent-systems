## Report notes
I collected some feedback / thoughts on the report, especially related to the data types passed through.

Hopefully these help to make it more consistent.

### Emergency Services
- [ ] will the emergency notifications for `FireReport` and `MedicalReport` be picked from the `CallAssessmentOutput` by the flow? Maybe this can just output `EmergencyReport`?
- [ ] fix mismatch in name `FireReport` and `FireReportOutput`

### Firefighting
- [ ] update `priority_level` of `FireFightingActivity` to be an enum
- [ ] update firefighting response to not include `success`
    - I think this should instead be a FireFightingPlan or something
> class ReportFirefightingResponseOutput ( BaseModel ) :
> 	summary : str
> 	timestamp : str
> 	success : bool

### Medical Services
- [ ] `ReceiveReportOutput` in medical services includes a `timestamp`
    - I think this should be removed, or we should use it consistently, like in the FireFighting activity
- [ ] `timestamps` could be `datetime` types

### Public Communications
- [ ] is `report_id` needed for `ReceiveReportOutput`?
- [ ] if `fire_type` is needed, we should include more structured data
- [ ] should `RelatedCase.location` use `tuple[float, float]` instead of `str`?

### General
- [ ] estimated arrival times could be `datetime` types
- [ ] specifying XYZOutput seems unnecessary, and it can lead to confusion if team B uses the XYZOutput from team A, since now it's an input
- [ ] we could instead use a suffix naming convention like:
    - `XYZ`: datatype specific to the activity/crew. e.g.
        - `HospitalResources`, `FirefightingResources`, `RelatedCase`
    - `XYZReport`: reports that are passed between teams
        - `FireReport`, `MedicalReport`, `EmergencyReport`
