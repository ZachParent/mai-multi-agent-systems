- Mari
	- process definition
	- detailed the emergency call data that comes to the emergency call agent
	- [emergency_services](../reports/task2-report/sections/process_definition/emergency_services.tex)
	- bruno already added some structure, so maybe there is conflict
- Bruno
	- we each did process definition, which are the tasks within each crew
	- sequential / parallel execution
	- each task has a pydantic data model defined
	- it's most important to agree on the first task structure and last task structure for
	- each crew has one process
	- the process is run once in sequence in the flow
- bruno simplified the medical services crew to make it static, and they know exactly what is needed on site
- Antonio
	- we are just 
- emergency -> router -> fire and/or medical services -> public communications
- sheena: shouldn't the medical services happen after fire, so they know how many injured
- antonio: we are only planning, so the fire team never gets to the scene
- bruno: we thought about having a fire expert and medical expert in the emergency team
- zach: this smells funny
19:20
- zach: how do we synthesize all of these outputs into one output?
- antonio: public announcement team gets it together
- bruno: the flow will kick off the crews then get the results and concatenate it programmatically
- antonio: the public communication team pydantic output shows how the crew's output looks
- the flow will kick off fire and/or medical services in parallel
19:30
- mari explains the structure of the CallAssessmentOuptut data
- bruno points out that this may not be the right task for an LLM, since it's so highly structured
- team confirms that the input is a markdown format of an emergency call that needs to get translated into structure form
19:35
- team agrees to write pydantic data types in code, then copy them to the report/presentation
- let's use structured data where we can, instead of dictionaries
19:45
- zach will manage agreement between data types and processes once they're ready
- we will all wrap crew setup by Tuesday 2024-12-03
- we will make a presentation after the report is ready, 8-10 slides
- might be difficult to fit all this in the presentation
