### Agent Descriptions

#### Dispatcher Agent
- **Description**: The Dispatcher Agent is the primary contact point for incoming emergency calls, responsible for gathering critical information from the caller and determining the severity and type of incident.
- **Main Task**: To receive, assess, and classify emergency calls, then alert the necessary response units (e.g., Fire and Medical Services).
- **Tools**:
    -*Communication Software* : digital call-taking software to talk with callers and log the conversation.
    -*Data Entry Interface* : computer system or software to type in emergency details and record information systematically.
    -*Incident Assessment Tools* : map to quickly find and verify the caller’s location and assess the scene (could also include software for prioritizing the severity of the incident if needed).
- **Type**: **Interface Agent** – This type emphasizes autonomy and learning to support users. In this case, the Dispatcher Agent acts as a user interface for emergency call handling, gathering caller input and making proactive decisions on incident categorization.
- **Properties**:
  - *Reactivity*: The Dispatcher Agent continuously interacts with the environment (incoming calls) and rapidly assesses each situation to provide an appropriate response.
  - *Proactiveness*: While primarily reactive, the Dispatcher takes initiative by categorizing and prioritizing incidents, ensuring the most urgent cases receive immediate attention.
  - *Social Ability*: Capable of basic communication with other agents and potentially human responders, using a structured communication protocol for efficient incident coordination.
  - *Autonomy*: Operates independently once set up, requiring minimal external input to manage call processing and categorization.

#### Communication Relay Agent
- **Description**: A bridge agent that ensures timely and accurate transmission of information between the Dispatcher Agent and emergency response teams.
- **Main Task**: To relay details about the incident to the respective emergency teams and manage ongoing updates throughout the response.
- **Tools**:
  - *Communication protocols* : passes the information collected by the Dispatcher Agent to the right teams (firefighters or medical services).
  - *Notification system* : continues to relay new updates or details as they come in, making sure no one is left out of important updates.
- **Type**: **Facilitator Agent** – This type emphasizes communication and interaction, managing the connections and information flow between agents. The Communication Relay Agent serves as the coordinator in the emergency response communication network.
- **Properties**:
  - *Reactivity*: Monitors changes from both Dispatcher inputs and emergency response team feedback, adjusting notifications and updates based on dynamic incident progress.
  - *Social Ability*: Engages in continuous communication with multiple agents in real-time, ensuring all parties are kept informed and aligned on incident status.
  - *Temporal Continuity*: Remains active throughout the duration of an incident, managing and providing updates until the situation is resolved.
  - *Flexibility*: Adapts to various communication protocols and priority levels, adjusting its actions according to the severity of the situation and the availability of response teams.
