# 2024-12-28

## deliverables
- code
    - README.md
    - input files
    - src/
- final report
- final presentation

## meeting notes
- only changes from previous reports should be included
- the presentation can be just slides with plots
- just show the code structure
- can just present the IDE

- maybe we will make a presentation anyway, since we might get lost
- it's not intuitive to follow straightup code

- next steps
    - implement code
    - implement the prompts
    - run the code
    - possibly update code

- later
    - make a presentation
    - make a report

- we want to have one person make a model
- then the others can all use that model to be consistent
- antonio may already have an example we can use
- how do we test individuial crews/agents?
- is there a way to unit test?
- antonio will create an example today after the meeting

- deadlines
    - 2025-12-28: antonio will finish an example
    - 2025-01-02: everyone else is done with code + prompts + tests
    - 2025-01-02: meet to discuss next steps for report/presentation
