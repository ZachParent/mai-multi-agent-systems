## Adding crew

* a forensics crew with police, detective, maybe coroner

## Death in fires?
* it's realistic to have death
* different severity of fire might have different likelihood of death

## Setting up environment
* should we have a communicator agent in each crew
* how do the firefighters coordinate with other crews
    * what would they say to each other?
    * maybe they update the other team on fire progress
    * deliver bodies/victims to other crews
    * initial reports
* Mari: if we have 5 different crews then each of us can own one
    * what is the 5th crew?
    * could be Public Announcement crew
* that means we will have the following crews:
    * emergency services
    * fire fighters
    * medical services
    * forensics
    * public announcements
