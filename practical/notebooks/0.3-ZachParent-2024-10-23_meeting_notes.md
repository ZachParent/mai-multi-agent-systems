# 2024-10-23 notes

**Notetaker:** @ZachParent

9:35am start

## Maps
* Bruno suggests Salamanca
* Zach suggests Tossa de Mar
* Mari mentions that Tossa de Mar is kinda small
* Antonio suggests Lloret de Mar

## Review assignment
* We need to add prof to github

## Adding crew
* coroner?
* mayor?
* forensics?
* criminal?
* a forensics crew with police, detective, maybe coroner

## Death in fires?
* it's realistic to have death
* different severity of fire might have different likelihood of death

10:00am

## Setting up environment
* should we have a communicator agent in each crew
* how do the firefighters coordinate with other crews
    * what would they say to each other?
    * maybe they update the other team on fire progress
    * deliver bodies/victims to other crews
    * initial reports
* Mari: if we have 5 different crews then each of us can own one
    * what is the 5th crew?
    * could be Public Announcement crew
* that means we will have the following crews:
    * emergency services
    * fire fighters
    * medical services
    * forensics
    * public announcements

10:10am

## Evaluating the environment
* Bruno has created an evaluation already
* he needs to add it to the repo. currently in Notion
* e.g. continuous, non-deterministic

## What should each agent definition include
* description of what the agent does
* list the properties
* main tasks
* not goals
* not backstory

## How do we create the fire inputs
* X and Y cannot be generated well by LLM
* some text or details could be written by an LLM
* we could use Python to generate the markdown report, and it could reference an LLM for some parts
* having a narrative will be important, for example for the forensics team

10:20am

## Fire stations and hospitals
* it's important to be realistic
* also important to have more than one of each
* we could invent a new one if needed
* do we model the individual teams of firefighters at different locations as different crews?
    * we can have a class of firefighter, and particular instances of firefighters which are assigned to a particular station
    * if there are 3 stations with 3 members each, that's 9 agents, assigned to their respective stations

## Defining the agent crews and their agents
* **emergency services**
    * dispatch: gets the call
    * operator (facilitator): sends the report to the other crews
        * decides which services + local crews to call
* **fire fighters**
    * captain (facilitator): manages the team, takes calls, is more senior, supports the firefighter 
    * engineer (coordinator): manages the equipment, supplies water, drives the fire engine
    * firefighter: enters the building and puts out the fire

10:30am

Brainstorm
* we need some sort of operator who manages resources and communicates
* Sheena: we should model hospitals with nurses and doctors
* some injuries could be solves on site, others need transport
* facilitator is a general MAS term for an agent role which is in charge of communicating between crews
    * for some crews, there is a natural facilitator, like the fire captain or the emergency services operator

* **medical services**
    * medical services operator (facilitator): manages resources, takes calls from emergency services,
    * hopsital coordinator (coordinator): 
    * paramedic: 
* **forensics**
    * forensics operator (facilitator): 
    * coroner: retrieves bodies of the dead, brings them to the morgue and performs investigation to help the investigator
    * investigator: perform forensics to determine the cause of the fire
* **public announcements**
    * (facilitator): 
    * info agent:
    * journalist: 
    * radio announcer:
    * mayor:

10:50am

* what should the members of public announcements team be?
    * keep it simple, just mayor (for extreme cases) and radio announcer

10:56am

Assignments:
* emergency services
    * Mari
* fire fighters
    * Sheena
* medical services
    * Bruno
* forensics
    * Zach
* public announcements
    * Antonio

* Everyone should do agent selection + definition, agent taxonomy
* Bruno: Could Mari look over the environment analysis?

11:00

Check that everyone knows their tasks
