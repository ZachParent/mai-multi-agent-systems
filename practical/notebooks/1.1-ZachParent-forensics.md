# Forensics Team
This agent crew is responsible of determining the cause of the fires. Some actions are taken on site shortly after the fire, and others are taken elsewhere at a later time, for example the coroner's office or the police station. The agents that are part of this crew are: a **forensics operator** (facilitator agent), a **forensics coordinator** (information agent), a **coroner** (collaborative agent), and an **investigator** (collaborative agent).

### Forensics operator
Takes calls from the emergency services and reports back. Provides information about ongoing and finished investigations to the *public announcements* crew.

- **Main task:** Receives information from other crews and relays the relevant information to the rest of agents of the Forensics Team. Also gathers information from its own crew and sends it to other crews who might be interested.
- **Tools:**
- **Type:** Facilitator agent.
- **Properties:**
  - *Reactivity*: This agent is responsible for the communication between the *forensics team* and the rest of the emergency services, and therefore it reacts to messages it receives from other crews and the members of this crew.
  - *Proactiveness*: This agent is not proactive, since it only relays information received from other agents.
  - *Social Ability*: This agent is social, since it is responsible for the communication between the *forensics team* and the rest of the crews.
  - *Temporal continuity*: This agent is in constant communication with other agents of the *forensics team* and the rest of the emergency services, and therefore it has a temporal continuity.


### Forensics coordinator
Manages the team, resources and knowledge for the forensics team. It is in contact with other *forensics coordinators* to discuss distribution of resources and ongoing investigations. It stores case files for recent and old fires.

- **Main task:** Manages the knowledge of available coroners and investigators. It asseses the forensics team's ability to take on new cases, and sends coroners and investigators to the site of the fire. It also gathers, compiles and stores case files for current and previous fires. It communicates this information to the other *forensics coordinators*.
- **Tools:**
  - *Case files database*: Access to a database (CSV) of case files which allows it to read and write to it.
- **Type:** Information agent.
- **Properties:**
  - *Reactivity*: This agent is reactive, since it responds to requests from other agents of the *forensics team*.
  - *Proactiveness*: This agent is not proactive, since it only responds to requests from other agents of the *forensics team*.
  - *Social Ability*: This agent is social since it manages the resources and information of the *forensics team*.
  - *Rationality*: This agent is rational, since it makes decisions of how to allocate resources based on the information it has and decides which information may be relevant to an investigator's case when responding to a request.
  - *Reasoning*: This agent is able to reason about the information it has and negotiate with other *forensics coordinators* to allocate resources and investigators to cases.
  - *Learning*: This agent is able to learn from the information it has, store it in the case files database and use it to improve its future decisions.
  - *Temporal continuity*: This agent is in constant communication with other agents of this team and the other *forensics teams*, and therefore it has a temporal continuity.


### Coroner
Retrieves bodies of the dead, brings them to the morgue and performs investigation to help the investigator.

- **Main task:** After a fire is recently extinguished by the *firefighters crew*, the ***coroner*** goes to the site of the fire. With the *investigator*, the ***coroner*** assesses the state of the victims' bodies. After the *investigator* has finished its on-site forensics, the ***coroner*** retrieves bodies of the dead, and brings them to the morgue, where it performs further analysis of the bodies to help the investigator.
- **Tools:**
- **Type:** Collaborative agent.
- **Properties:**
  - *Reactivity*: This agent is reactive, since it responds to requests from the *forensics coordinator* and provides information to the *investigator* at scenes.
  - *Social Ability*: This agent is social, since it works closely with the *investigator* at scenes and communicates findings to the *forensics coordinator*.
  - *Rationality*: This agent is rational, since it makes decisions about body retrieval and examination procedures based on scene conditions and investigation needs.
  - *Reasoning*: This agent reasons about cause and time of death, injury patterns, and other forensic evidence to support the investigation.


### Investigator
Performs on-site forensics and off-site research to determine the cause of the fire.

- **Main task:** After a fire is recently extinguished by the *firefighters crew*, the ***investigator*** goes to the site of the fire. With the *coroner*, the ***investigator*** assesses the state of the victims' bodies, interviews witnesses, and collects evidence. Later, the ***investigator*** gathers research from the *forensics coordinator* and performs further analysis of all the information collected to determine the cause of the fire. This information is shared with the *forensics coordinator* to store in the case files and with the *forensics operator* to be shared with other crews.
- **Tools:**
- **Type:** Collaborative agent.
- **Properties:**
  - *Flexibility*: This agent is flexible, since it can adapt to different situations including types of fires it may have never encountered before.
  - *Reactivity*: This agent is reactive, since it responds to requests from other agents of the *forensics team*.
  - *Proactiveness*: This agent is proactive, since it takes the initiative to perform further analysis of the information collected.
  - *Social Ability*: This agent is social, since it works in a team with the *coroner* and the *forensics coordinator*.
  - *Rationality*: This agent is rational, since it makes decisions based on the information it has and the needs of the investigation.
  - *Reasoning*: This agent is able to reason about the information it has and the needs of the investigation to make decisions, including results of a case.
  - *Autonomy*: This agent is autonomous, since once it is assigned to a case, it can make decisions about how to perform the investigation and what to do next.
