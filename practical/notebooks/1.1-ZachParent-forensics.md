# Forensics Team
This agent crew is responsible of determining the cause of the fires. Some actions are taken on site shortly after the fire, and others are taken elsewhere at a later time, for example the coroner's office or the police station. The agents that are part of this crew are: a **forensics operator** (facilitator agent), a **forensics coordinator** (information agent), a **coroner** (collaborative agent), and an **investigator** (collaborative agent).
