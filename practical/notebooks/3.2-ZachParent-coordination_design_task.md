# 2. Task 2 - Coordination design
**Description:** In this task you will define the cooperation and coordination mechanisms that will
be used to solve the emergency response problem. There are three main steps:

1. **Process definition:** For each individual crew, define which type of process they will
follow (e.g., sequential or hierarchical). You must specify how the sequence of tasks will
be executed (or how you envision it to be in the hierarchical case). Moreover, define if
some of them are executed in parallel or asynchronously and any other Tasks properties
if required (human input, context, etc).
2. **Pydantic Outputs:** Define Pydantic outputs (As seen on Lab 5) for tasks that you think
would benefit from structured outputs.
3. **Agent Interaction:** Define how the different agent crews will interact. You must use
flows and at least one router (As seen on Lab 8).

Write a detailed explanation of your choices and justification for the decisions you take.

**Delivery content:** PDF report with the proposed cooperation and coordination mechanisms for the MAS. PDF with 8-10 slides for a presentation of up to 10 minutes.

**Delivery deadline:** 8/12/2024
**Grade weight:** 10%
