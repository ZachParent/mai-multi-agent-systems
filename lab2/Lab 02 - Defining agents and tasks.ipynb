    "Welcome to the first practical lab of MAS!\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the basics of defining agents and tasks using the CrewAI library. It is a Python framework that provides a simple way for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. By fostering collaborative intelligence, CrewAI empowers agents to work together seamlessly, tackling complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use CrewAI?\n",
    "The CrewAI library provides a flexible and scalable way to define agents and tasks. It is designed to enable AI agents to assume roles, share goals, and operate in a cohesive unit. You can focus on the logic of your agents without worrying about the underlying implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are we going to cover in this notebook?\n",
    "In this notebook, we will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialising CrewAI with Ollama\n",
    "2. Defining Agents\n",
    "3. Defining Tasks\n",
    "4. Example Use Case\n",

    "Let's get started!\n",

    "CrewAI's Multi-Agent System framework is based on ReAct to create sophisticated, adaptable systems that can reason, communicate, and collaborate effectively without an user telling all the steps they have to perform. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Thought**: Agents use an LLM to \"\"think/reason\"\" about the given context and decide on an action.\n",
    "2. **Action**: Based on their thought, agents formulate an action from a predefined list of possible actions they can perform.\n",
    "3. **Action Input**: The agent provides input for the chosen action (e.g., search query).\n",
    "4. **Observation**: The agent performs the action and returns the result as an observation (e.g., search results).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the process has been completed, the observation will be added to the context and the loop will be repeated until the task is completed.\n",

    "## Example: Article Writing\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the usage of CrewAI, we'll be using the following example. We''ll create a small Multi-Agent System that researches on a given topic and writes an article on that topic for a blog, webpage, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, this kind of ReAct MAS are like role-playing games. As in the real world, each [agent](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Agents/) in the team will play a specific role.\n",
    "To define an agent, we must provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **role**: The role of the agent\n",
    "- **goal**: The specific goal of the agent\n",
    "- **backstory**: The context of that agent. Who is, what is working on, etc. The more detailed, the better results will be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: there are two ways of creating multiple line strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple strings:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable = \"first line, \"\n",
    "           \"second line.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Docstrings:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable = \"\"\"first line,\n",
    "              second line\n",
    "           \"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple strings** are preferred because they avoid adding whitespaces and newlines, making better formatted by the underlying LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To [set the LLM](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/), we just need to provide a string with the model. In case of using llama3.1 through ollama, it would be `ollama/llama3.1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, there's the skeleton on how to create an agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "agent = Agent(\n",
    "    role='Agent role',\n",
    "    goal='Agent goal',\n",
    "    backstory='Agent backstory',\n",
    "    verbose=[True|False],\n",
    "    allow_delegation=[False|True],\n",
    "    llm='ollama/model_name'\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** the additional parameters that enable you to customize your agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `verbose`: whether all outputs of the agent should be printed or not.\n",
    "- `allow_delegation`: whether the agent can delegate work to other agents or not. For now, we'll set this to `False`.\n",
    "- `llm`: the variable holding our LLM model, which in this case is `ollama`. If this isn't defined, it will default to OpenAI, but that will raise errors if not configured properly."
